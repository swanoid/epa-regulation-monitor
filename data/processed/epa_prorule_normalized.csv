We further propose, in the alternative, to rescind the Administrator's prior findings in 2009 because the EPA unreasonably analyzed the scientific record and because developments cast significant doubt on the reliability of the findings.

US,Federal Register,2025-01-22,National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Chemical Manufacturing Area Sources Technology Review,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to establish a new area source category to address chemical manufacturing process units (CMPUs) using ethylene oxide (EtO). The EPA is proposing to list EtO in table 1 to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Chemical Manufacturing Area Sources (referred to as the CMAS NESHAP in this document) and to add EtO- specific requirements to the CMAS NESHAP. The EPA is also proposing to add a fenceline monitoring program for EtO. In addition, the EPA is proposing new requirements for pressure vessels and pressure relief devices (PRDs). This proposal also presents the results of the EPA's technology review of the CMAS NESHAP as required under the Clean Air Act (CAA). As part of this technology review, the EPA is proposing to add new leak detection and repair (LDAR) requirements to the CMAS NESHAP for equipment leaks in organic HAP service and heat exchange systems. The EPA is also proposing performance testing once every 5 years and to add provisions for electronic reporting. We estimate that the proposed amendments to the CMAS NESHAP, excluding the proposed EtO emission standards, would reduce hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions from emission sources by approximately 158 tons per year (tpy). Additionally, the proposed EtO emission standards are expected to reduce EtO emissions by approximately 4.6 tpy.","[{'raw_name': 'ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY', 'name': 'Environmental Protection Agency', 'id': 145, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/environmental-protection-agency', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/145', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'environmental-protection-agency'}]",https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/22/2025-00685/national-emission-standards-for-hazardous-air-pollutants-chemical-manufacturing-area-sources

First, this action proposes discrete technical changes to the temporary flaring provisions for associated gas in certain situations. Second, this action proposes discrete technical changes to the vent gas net heating value (NHV) continuous monitoring requirements and alternative performance test (sampling demonstration) option for flares and enclosed combustion devices. In a letter dated May 6, 2024, the EPA notified petitioners and the public that the Agency granted reconsideration on these two aspects of the March 8, 2024 (89 FR 16820) final rule. These amendments neither propose changes to any other aspect of the final rule, nor propose to alter the substance of any emission standards within the final rule.

The EPA is proposing decisions resulting from the Agency's technology review of the PEPO NESHAP and decisions based on its reconsideration of certain issues raised in an administrative petition for reconsideration. Furthermore, the EPA is proposing to strengthen the emission standards for ethylene oxide (EtO) emissions after considering the results of a risk assessment for the PEPO NESHAP. The EPA is also proposing to require performance testing once every 5 years, to add work practice standards for certain activities where alternatives are appropriate, and to add provisions for electronic reporting. We estimate that the proposed amendments to the PEPO NESHAP, excluding the EtO emission standards, would reduce hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions from PEPO sources by approximately 157 tons per year (tpy). Additionally, the proposed EtO emission standards are expected to reduce EtO emissions by approximately 14 tpy.

The intended effect of the NJDEP's revisions to the SIP, is to regulate the construction and modification of stationary sources with adequate requirements to ensure that the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) are satisfied. In addition, the NJDEP's revisions will strengthen the SIP by conforming it with the State regulations that were in effect at the time of the SIP submission.

The SNURs require persons who intend to manufacture (defined by statute to include import) or process any of these chemical substances for an activity that is proposed as a significant new use by this rulemaking to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing that activity. The required notification initiates EPA's evaluation of the conditions of that use for that chemical substance. In addition, the manufacture or processing for the significant new use may not commence until EPA has conducted a review of the required notification, made an appropriate determination regarding that notification, and taken such actions as required by that determination.","[{'raw_name': 'ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY', 'name': 'Environmental Protection Agency', 'id': 145, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/environmental-protection-agency', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/145', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'environmental-protection-agency'}]",https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/12/17/2024-29275/significant-new-use-rules-on-certain-chemical-substances-24-35e

This modification is necessary because the EPA is the permitting authority in Lands of Exclusive Federal Jurisdiction, and when the CGP was issued on February 17, 2022, the permit did not specifically provide eligibility for all of these areas. The proposed modification would also clarify the CGP requirements that apply to projects that discharge to receiving waters within Lands of Exclusive Federal Jurisdiction.

US,Federal Register,2024-12-13,Review of New Source Performance Standards for Stationary Combustion Turbines and Stationary Gas Turbines,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing amendments to the Standards of Performance for new, modified, and reconstructed stationary combustion turbines and stationary gas turbines based on a review of available control technologies for limiting emissions of criteria air pollutants. This review of the new source performance standards (NSPS) is required by the Clean Air Act (CAA). As a result of this review, the EPA is proposing to establish size-based subcategories for new, modified, and reconstructed stationary combustion turbines that also recognize distinctions between those that operate at varying loads or capacity factors and those firing natural gas or non-natural gas fuels. In general, the EPA is proposing that combustion controls with the addition of post-combustion selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is the best system of emission reduction (BSER) for limiting nitrogen oxide (NO<INF>X</INF>) emissions from this source category, with certain, limited exceptions. Based on the application of this BSER and other updates in technical information, the EPA is proposing to lower the NO<INF>X</INF> standards of performance for most of the stationary combustion turbines included in this source category. In addition, for new, modified, and reconstructed stationary combustion turbines that fire or co-fire hydrogen, the EPA is proposing to ensure that those sources are subject to the same level of control for NO<INF>X</INF> emissions as sources firing natural gas or non-natural gas fuels, depending on the percentage of hydrogen fuel being utilized. The EPA is proposing to maintain the current standards for sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) emissions, because after reviewing the current SO<INF>2</INF> standards, we propose to find that the use of low-sulfur fuels remains the BSER. Finally, the Agency is proposing amendments to address specific technical and editorial issues to clarify the existing regulations.","[{'raw_name': 'ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY', 'name': 'Environmental Protection Agency', 'id': 145, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/environmental-protection-agency', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/145', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'environmental-protection-agency'}]",https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/12/13/2024-27872/review-of-new-source-performance-standards-for-stationary-combustion-turbines-and-stationary-gas

The SIP revision incorporates by reference (IBRs) certain amendments EPA has made to the regulations for the Federal CSAPR trading programs for annual emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) and sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) for large electric generating units (EGUs).
